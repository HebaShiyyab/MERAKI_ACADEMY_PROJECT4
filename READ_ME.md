## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Bliss Charity is meant for helping needed people and those who don't know 
how/where to donate. This website acts like a link between the donors <br/> and cases, the idea came up because of the lack of such websites in Jordan.<br/>

People in need are able to login and ask for donations in a private way, without<br/>
showing their personal information.
